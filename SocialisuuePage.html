<h1> Math, Science, Social Studies, English...and Art</h1>

<p>Students often worry about having to hand in an english essay or 
  perhaps having to study for an upcoming math test, but they almost never think about art. In fact, some countries ignore art completely.
  Because of this, students begin to not care about art as a whole. Things like science and math are considered to hold more value over art.
  We hear announcements all over the globe about how schools have started to incorporate more STEM activities or new programs, however,
  art matters too.
</p>


<p>
It is true that subjects like science and math are very important, but it is the combination of these skills 
that allow us to be successful in our day-today lives.
They are intertwined and mutually supportive. Imagine a society without knowledge of languages, how to write, 
or how to design and create.
